w 08 00 17 p ;w determines the start of the communication.   
; 08 is the address of the EZI2C, 00 is the control register 0 address. 
;the next command represent the content of the control register 0
;if it is set to 17(hexadecimal), it corresponds to the succession of bits: 010111,  
;where the first four bits represents the number of samples to average(in our case 5) 
;and the last two bits represent the status (in this case they are set to 11-the LED is ON).
;p determines the stop of the communication.
W 08 03 P r 08 @1temp @0temp @1ldr @0ldr p
; the third command of this line (03) represents the register addressed 0x03.
; the command starting with r( reading) allows us to read the values from the sensors(in hexadecimal)
; in our case having two sensors, 5 samples each, by changing the status bits values (01, 10) 
;we show the other configurations; in particular:
w 08 00 16 p ;16 (hexadecimal), corresponds to the succession of bits: 010110 
W 08 03 P r 08 @0temp @0temp @0ldr @0ldr p
; we only read the values relative to the LDR sensor
w 08 00 15 p; 15(hexadecimal), corresponds to the succession of bits: 010101
W 08 03 P r 08 @0temp @0temp @0ldr @0ldr p
; we only read the values relative to the Temperature sensor
